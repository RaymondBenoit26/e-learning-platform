## üóÑ Database Schema

### Core Models

#### Users
- Students, instructors, management, and super admins
- Belongs to a school (except super admins)
- Has many enrollments, license accesses, and payments
- Polymorphic associations for flexible enrollment types

#### Schools
- Contains terms, courses, and users
- Each school operates independently
- Has address and contact information

#### Terms
- Academic periods with start/end dates and descriptions
- Contains courses and has many licenses (polymorphic)
- Students can enroll directly in terms or access via course enrollments

#### Courses
- Belong to terms and have instructor assignments
- Contain chapters and course content
- Can have direct licenses (polymorphic) or inherit from term licenses
- Students access courses through various enrollment paths

#### Licenses (Polymorphic)
- **Polymorphic Association**: Can belong to terms or courses via `licensable`
- **Types**: Standard, Premium, Enterprise, Lifetime
- **Pricing**: Configurable price and seat limits
- **Expiration**: Automatic expiration handling with background jobs
- **Access Control**: Controls student access to learning materials

#### License Accesses
- **Purchase Tracking**: Links students to purchased licenses
- **Status Management**: pending, active, expired, cancelled
- **Payment Integration**: Connected to payment records for full audit trail
- **Automatic Enrollment**: Creates enrollments when license becomes active

#### Payments (Polymorphic)
- **Multi-Method Support**: 9 different payment methods
- **Polymorphic Payable**: Can be linked to various payment sources
- **Breakdown Tracking**: Detailed payment breakdown with line items
- **Processing Status**: Realistic payment processing with background jobs

#### Enrollments (Polymorphic)
- **Flexible Enrollment**: Can enroll in terms or courses via `enrollable`
- **Status Tracking**: active, suspended, completed, cancelled
- **Payment Linkage**: Connected to payments via `payable` for source tracking
- **Automatic Creation**: Created automatically when license purchases succeed

## üîê License Purchase & Access System

### How It Works
1. **License Creation**: Admins create licenses for terms or courses with pricing and expiration
2. **Student Purchase**: Students select payment method and purchase licenses
3. **Payment Processing**: Background job processes payment with realistic delays and success rates
4. **Automatic Enrollment**: Successful payments automatically create enrollments
5. **Access Control**: Students can access materials only with valid active licenses
6. **Expiration Management**: Background jobs handle license expiration and access suspension
7. **Renewal Process**: Students can renew expired licenses to restore access

### Payment Processing Flow
```
Student Purchase ‚Üí Payment Record Created ‚Üí Background Job Processing ‚Üí 
Payment Success ‚Üí License Access Activated ‚Üí Enrollment Created ‚Üí Access Granted
```

### Payment Methods & Success Rates
- **Credit/Debit Cards**: 95% success rate, 2-5 second processing
- **Bank Transfer**: 98% success rate, 1-3 second processing  
- **PayPal/Stripe**: 97% success rate, 1-2 second processing
- **Cash/Free/Waived**: 100% success rate, instant processing

### Background Jobs
- **LicensePaymentProcessingJob**: Processes payments with realistic delays
- **LicenseExpirationJob**: Runs daily to process expired licenses
- **FixPendingEnrollmentsJob**: Handles enrollment cleanup tasks

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Creating Polymorphic Licenses
```ruby
# Term license
term.licenses.create!(
  name: "Fall 2024 Access",
  price: 299.99,
  max_seats: 100,
  license_type: "standard",
  expires_at: term.end_date + 1.month
)

# Course license
course.licenses.create!(
  name: "Advanced Ruby Course",
  price: 99.99,
  max_seats: 50,
  license_type: "premium",
  expires_at: 6.months.from_now
)
```

### Student License Purchase
```ruby
# Student purchases with payment method
license_access = student.license_accesses.create!(
  license: license,
  payment_method: "credit_card",
  amount_paid: license.price,
  status: "pending"
)

# Payment processing job handles the rest
LicensePaymentProcessingJob.perform_later(license_access.id)
```

### Checking Student Access
```ruby
# Check if student has access to term
student.can_access_term?(term)

# Check if student has access to course
student.can_access_course?(course)

# Get all active license accesses
student.license_accesses.active
```

## üîß Configuration

### Background Job Setup
```ruby
# config/application.rb
config.active_job.queue_adapter = :async # or :sidekiq for production
```

### Payment Method Configuration
```ruby
# In LicenseAccess model
enum payment_method: {
  credit_card: 0,
  debit_card: 1, 
  bank_transfer: 2,
  paypal: 3,
  stripe: 4,
  cash: 5,
  scholarship: 6,
  waived: 7,
  free: 8
}
```
